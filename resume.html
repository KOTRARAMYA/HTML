    <p><b>PROJECTS:</b><br>==>INNOVATIVE TENSOR ANALYSIS FOR ATRAIL ABNORMALITIES
        <br> Our work introduces a novel method leveraging multi-channel ECG signals. We employ Gramian 
        angular field transformation for temporal dynamics and ECG tensor analysis for spatiotemporal 
        pattern analysis. Unsupervised machine learning clustering aids in explicit labeling of atrial problem 
        clusters, outperforming traditional methods in sensitivity and specificity across diverse patient 
        cohorts and ECG scenarios.</p>
